We are going to implement SQLite for general save load,
Knowned issue:

	the game will have at least 25002 entries, if we insert them one by one,
	it will take at least 3~5 min to I/O.

	I analyzed the process of writing, and I found that it will  generate 
	journal file before writing into the database, which means each time we
	execute a command, it need to generate a file and delete it when we finish
	execution, pretty tedious.

	To solve I/O efficien issue, we need to utilize Bulk Insert to wrap all 
	native datainto a command, and execute it when saving game.
